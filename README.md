Hi there..  I'm P45. 

This is a python script for downloads epub files from gutenberg.org based on search query; and it will automatically rename the filename (e.g. from "1342" into "Pride and Prejudice.epub).

For example, if you want to download all 'Oscar Wilde' book, you can change:

f=urllib2.urlopen("http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?query=jane+austen")

into:

f=urllib2.urlopen("http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?query=oscar+wilde")



I owe much to Michiel Overtoom, since I use many of his script and modify several things.
